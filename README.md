## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was my first HTML & CSS based project where I implemented JavaScript as well. I learned more of HTML & CSS in this project in addition to the basics of JavaScript and how to implement it in HTML.

### Continued development

I would like to practice implementing JavaScript in HTML more and CSS Grid or my future projects.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) - This helped me in media query and active state for the JS implementation.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This resource helped me a lot in using flexbox and CSS.
